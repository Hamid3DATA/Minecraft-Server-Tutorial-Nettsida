This "project" was made to showcase our schools SolarEdge page and show different "Power and Energy" graphs, it was used on a 1024x768 monitor(4:3 aspect ratio).

So some things should be changed depending on the monitor being used, e.g. mouse cursor coordinates.

All you need to do is follow the "[Raspberry Pi - How to start website on boot.md](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/SolarEdge/blob/main/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20How%20to%20start%20website%20on%20boot.md)"
