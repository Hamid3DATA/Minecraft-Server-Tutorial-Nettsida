This "project" was made to showcase our schools SolarEdge page and show different "Power and Energy" graphs, it was used on a 1280x1024 monitor(5:4 aspect ratio).

So some things should be changed depending on the monitor being used, e.g. mouse cursor coordinates, the size you run cromium on etc.

If you want to do everything manually all you need to do is follow the "[Raspberry Pi - How to start website on boot.md](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/SolarEdge/blob/main/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20How%20to%20start%20website%20on%20boot.md)" file.

If you want to do everything automatically follow "[Automatic Setup.md](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/SolarEdge/blob/main/Automatic%20Setup.md)" file.
